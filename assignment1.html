This is a photo of my backyard. I must be feeling nostalgic as I do this assignment 
but I was really lucky to grow up in a house with beautiful green space and a lot of
sun, so I have so many happy memories outside with my family. to this day, it is a 
place that brings me so much peace and happiness.
